# py-openmodelrouter
LLM Model Router Project to let a LLM select another LLM before answering a question.

FastAPI application providing a simple web GUI and API endpoints for a multi-model
router based on Ollama and local GGUF models. This application exposes a
single-page interface for listing available models, downloading new models,
adjusting configuration parameters, querying the router, and inspecting the
router’s long‑term memory. It leverages a minimal front end built with
Jinja2 templates and vanilla JavaScript to remain compatible with a
restricted execution environment.
